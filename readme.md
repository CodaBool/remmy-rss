# Reddit + Lemmy = Remmy
> This will be an expanded version of [reddit-top-rss](https://github.com/johnwarne/reddit-top-rss) with added Lemmy support

### What does it do?
- Allows only the top percentage of posts to be shown in an RSS feed

### What it doesn't do
- **not** an RSS reader, this will only curate Reddit/Lemmy content into a consumable RSS feed

# ðŸš§ This is under construction ðŸ‘·
> [!WARNING]
> dev notes below. Hardhats required beyond this point!
